Welcome to Transparent af.

We are a new type of non-profit org.  Every org has values. Most have values that align with shareholder growth. Others are for good. We would like to be for good. But we could be anything. Our only value is to be transparent af. Everything else is secondary.

We plan on setting this site up soon. In the meantime, feel free to email tyler@transparentaf.org with any questions.
